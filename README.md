# gesture
Freeware version of an already existing gesture drawing software. Made completely from scratch in Qt and C++ and aims to reimplement all core features. Expected platforms are Windows and Mac. I may try to make it an Android app as well, but don't get your hopes up. Besides, do you really want to draw from a screen that small? I'm not sure how making programs for Linux works, but I may try to do that as well if it's as easy as telling Qt to compile for Linux.
